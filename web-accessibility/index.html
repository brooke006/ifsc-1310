        <h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Web Accessibility is designing and coding websites and webtools to ensure people with disabilites can use them as well as being accessible accross multiiple devices. 
        There are a wide range of disabilites to consider when ensuring your website is accessible, including:
        auditory:closed captions
        cognitive:simple navigation
        neurological:caution notification,lack of strobe or flashing effects
        physical:keyboard navigation
        visual:text-to-speech software, enlargeable features,color choices,
    </p>
    <h2>Why is it important</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons web accessibility may be important and nessessary to all people.
        From a businesness aspect this allows what you have to offer to be more accessible which would allow more profit.
        From a individual point if you live with a disability or a barrier this creates less hassle when browsing the web. Other than the examples listed in the first section, wanting to watch a program in a language different from what you native speak is a barrier, the ability to use closed caption is accessible to allow you to read in transaltion for your understanding.</p><p> Even without a disability having access to these innovations makes web browsing convenient. Some examples include having the option to opt for delivery or pick up instead of physically browsing a store.
        From a fundamental stand point providing web-accessibility allows everyone to be able to contribute to the web.    </p>
